    This prototype provides **performance coaches** and **players** with an overview of key performance data across the following areas:

    1. **Biography** â€“ Player identity: photo, nationality, position, age, team, and league.  
    2. **Load Demand** â€“ Match and training load based on GPS KPIs.
    3. **Physical Development** â€“ Test results, development plans, strength & conditioning logs, and priority areas.  
    4. **Recovery** â€“ Insights on sleep, wellness, nutrition, and behavioural adherence.  
    5. **Injury History** â€“ Recent injuries.  
    6. **Individual Priority** â€“ Player-specific focus areas and development needs.  
    7. **External Factors** â€“ Contextual influences such as environment, team dynamics, and motivation.  
    8. **Case Explorer** â€“ Browse and compare tabular performance data.  
    9. **Help** â€“ Reference Chelsea FC's physical performance data sources.
    
    For personalized recommendations, the dashboard includes an "AI Sports Scientist" powered by [Mistral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistral_AI)'s **free** [LLM model](https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/models/models_overview). 
    
    This aligns with how AI is already used in elite football, see [AAVA for recovery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s55HF_PKuOk) or [Sevilla FCâ€™s scouting with Llama](https://sevillafc.es/en/actual/news/sevilla-fc-chosen-meta-example-use-artificial-intelligence).

    This dashboard in general is mobile-friendly, built with [Python](https://www.python.org), [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io), [Plotly](https://plotly.com), and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org).
